# StreamlinedIT Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 

There were many changes made during the implementation due to time constraints after I was sick for nearly a month
and this caused a lot of stress.  The changes were made to simplify the design and still achieve the goals of the
project. I feel like the overall concept was successful in its implementation.  There are alot of elements to the 
project that I would like to add in the future to make it more robust. These were removed to save time and be able to 
finish the project in the time frame given, even though I was sick for a month.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?

The user stories helped to define the project in a customer oriented fashion.  The overall design became focused on 
the straightest line between making a ticket and resolving the ticket. This was the main goal of the project.

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?

Problems were solved through outside research and asking for help from peers in communcation channels such as slack and 
element.

* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?

I was solo.  The overall commitments were self guided and the largest struggle was the stress of loosing time to 
sickness.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?

My solo stand-ups helped keep me mentally on track.  The hardest time was when I was sick and could not work on the
project.  During this time my coaches and peers were very supportive and helped me to get back on track as well as 
keeping me mentally on task to get healthy and back to work.

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?

I underestimated the amount of work that I could complete.  I was sick for a month and this caused a lot of stress.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?

I would have tried to not get sick, or having gotten sick, would have gone to the doctor sooner.  I would now have
experience in the project and would be able to apply that to my work in later units and capstone. The project was
successful in its implementation, and I would like to continue to work on it in the future. There are many elements
that I would like to add to make it more robust.
