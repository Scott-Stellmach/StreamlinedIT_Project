

Project Overview:

The overall reality here is that the project is far from complete.  I accept this as I was sick for a month during the
project development and I was working solo.  I have made great progress and I am happy with the results at the current
stage.

Here are the things that the project is missing:

There is still no connection to a true database.
There is no set of unit tests.
There is no set of integration tests.
There are numerous ways that the code could be optimized.

There is a work-in-progress Swagger API design that has been started. It covers the concepts of how the API will work.
It does not cover all API endpoints. It covers only errors relevant to the currently implemented endpoints.

I present these admittedly incomplete results to you as a demonstration of my ability to learn and apply what I have
learned.  I will continue to work on this project as my personal time allows.  The overall result has taught me a great
deal about the process of software development and I am very happy with the results.
