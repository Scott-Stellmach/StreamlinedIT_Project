### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    
    Everyone should feel welcome to try new ideas and test the limits of their code
    on the project.  That being said, the team members should be testing all ideas, 
    in a safe environment, ie. a local branch.  After you have made the code complete
    task required present it to the team.  Nothing will ever be dismissed until we
    all have had a good look at it.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**

    We will strive to be a living example of these principles, communicate when there is a misunderstanding, don’t move forward
    until the situation is resolved, directly address and resolve negativity,
    give and receive feedback with a positive, strength-building mindset, if
    necessary, escalate to a BloomTech staff member. 

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**

     Trust, appropriately sizing tasks to make sure that individual members
    do not feel overwhelmed. Making time for team meetings, discussing progress and
    a member is feeling overwhelmed discuss how to break down a task further or to
    assist that member. The overall goal is no one should feel alone in a task, and
    they should always have a line of help to address their needs.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**

     We acknowledge the uncompleted task. Address the reasons it happened, and adjust
    the task layout to better complete it as soon as possible.  This may mean breaking
    it down, or getting another member to help with finishing it. Or even getting
    outside help, via instructors or LAs.

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
     As it is only a single team member, I will make detailed plans on what tasks should be
    completed each day. Taking one task at a time and not overwhelming myself will be key
    to keeping a good pace.


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**

    Put my skills to the test.  Develop a good start to a future portfolio project. 
    Gain confidence of my skills and make use of this confidence.


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**

    I will have gained confidence in my skills. Practiced all the work from the 
    start of Bloomtech till now.  I will see that it is not an overwhelming task,
    like it seems.  Mostly, I feel like I will grow in skill and add tools to my
    coding tool belt.


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
    
    I want to gain a better understanding of AWS, YAML, JSON, LAMBDA, and database
    calls.  The idea of everything still feels a little foreign.  I want to believe
    that I understand it and know how to develop with these tools.


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
  complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
    
    Mostly task development and organized planning to ensure that I stay on pace
    with tasks.  Also scope management, ensuring that I do not try to develop more
    than is needed.


## Meaning & Impact

**What is personally important for each team member about joining BloomTech? About
becoming an software engineer?**

* Scott: Learning to my fullest.  I need to change my place in life and this course
    is one of my best chances.


**What each team member wants to achieve: e.g. improve analytical skills, learn
project management skills, develop public speaking skills, speak up more, speak
up less, etc.**

* Scott: Tool mastery, I want to learn to use these tools as well as I can.
